## Building for Distribution

To create an executable file:
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a Windows installer in the `dist/` folder.

## Development with Amazon Q

To resume development conversations with Amazon Q:
```
Resume LaunchPad development - check @LaunchPad folder and CHAT_LOG.md
```

**What this does:**
- Loads the entire LaunchPad project context
- Reviews CHAT_LOG.md for previous development sessions
- Provides Amazon Q with current project status and features
- Enables immediate continuation of development work without re-explaining the project
